<h2>Gravity Tank</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
You pilot an experimental weapon, the Gravity Tank, capable of controlling it's gravity, to fight against enemy tanks and turrets to bring peace to the world.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Players will experience hectic gunfights while using gravity to evade enemy attacks and gain better vantage points from which to fight your enemy.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
platformer/shooter
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
You control the tank using the arrow keys. You can only move left and right when you are on the floor or ceiling, and can only move up or down when you are on the walls. You can change the tank's gravity using the WASD keys. W will set the gravity to upwards, S to downwards, A to the left, and D to the right. Press the Q and E keys to rotate the tank's cannon counter-clockwise and clockwise respectively. Press space to fire your weapon. This prototype only contains one weapon, the basic cannon, which shoots straight and continues until it hits an enemy or a wall. The tank cannot change direction, either of movement or gravity, while in the air; however, the tank will retain some of it's velocity when you change gravity. For example, if the tank is moving to the left and you shift the gravity upwards, your tank will continue moving to the left until it collides with a solid surface. 
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
The goal of this prototype are to show the basic mechanics of the game, such as changing the gravity and the shooting mechanics.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
This prototype contains the mechanic to alter gravity, move, and aim and shoot the cannon. The prototype also contains one kind of enemy, a basic turret, which will shoot towards the player regularly. In the future, the game will have more enemies, such as tanks and flying turrets, powerful boss enemies, and more weapons, such as a spreadshot and a slow but powerful missle.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
This game takes place in a futuristic world ravaged by war.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
Two civilizations have been at war for countless years. You have been chosen to pilot the experimental Gravity Tank, capable of altering gravity and weilding powerful weapons. Your mission is to use the Gravity Tank's abilities to infiltrate and destroy the enemy base and bring peace to the world.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
The target audience of this game is anyone that enjoys action platformers and 2D shooting games..
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
The prototype takes only a few minutes to play.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Use gravity to increase your mobility, evade enemy fire, and better position yourself to safely fight enemies. In the full game, you will also have a variety of weapons with various uses, for example, a spreadshot weapon that can easily take down groups of weak enemies, and a slow but powerful missle that can easily deal with more powerful single targets.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
All sprites were made myself. Sound effects were taken from soundbible.com. Music from incompetech.com.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
My game uses some code from the Phaser example "Starstruck" to implement a tilemap.
