<h2>Gravity Tank</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
You pilot an experimental weapon, the Gravity Tank, capable of controlling it's gravity, to fight against enemy tanks and turrets to bring peace to the world.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Players will experience hectic gunfights while using gravity to evade enemy attacks and gain better vantage points from which to fight your enemy.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
platformer/puzzle/shooter
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
The Gravity Tank moves by flipping its gravity, allowing it to stick to the walls and ceiling, using the WASD keys. The tank cannon is aimed using the mouse, and the left mouse button is used to shoot your equipped weapon. Press the space bar to switch your equipped weapon, between the Normal Shot, Spread Shot, Machine Gun, and Grenade Launcher.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
The goal of this prototype are to show the basic mechanics of the game, such as changing the gravity and the shooting mechanics.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
Gravity Tank contains a variety of enemies: Gravity Tanks, Flying Sentries, and Turrets. The enemy will also attempt to destroy the player by shooting them when in line of sight. There will also be mines in the enemy base, that can damage your tank. In addition to damaging your tank, there are also gravity mines that will flip the gravity of your tank. Your tank can fight back using different weapons. The Normal Shot simply shoots straight forward. The Spreadshot shoots a powerful but short-range spread of three bullets towards the cursor. The Machine Gun fires very rapidly, but is not very accurate or strong. The Grenade Launcher will arc towards the ground and explode when it hits a wall or enemy, damaging any enemy caught in the explosion.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
This game takes place in a futuristic world ravaged by war.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
Two civilizations have been at war for countless years. You have been chosen to pilot the experimental Gravity Tank, capable of altering gravity and weilding powerful weapons. Your mission is to use the Gravity Tank's abilities to infiltrate and destroy the enemy base and bring peace to the world.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
The target audience of this game is anyone that enjoys action platformers and 2D shooting games.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
5-15 minutes
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Use gravity to increase your mobility, evade enemy fire, and better position yourself to safely fight enemies. Use the different weapons to your advantage. For example, the normal bullet is good for taking accurately picking off enemies at a range, the spread shot is good for fighting nearby enemy clusters or enemies with high health (such as the Gravity Tank), and the Grenade Launcher is good for hitting enemies through or around thin and short walls.
